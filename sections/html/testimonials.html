      The AI Program was a game changer for me! Our Mentor, Samina simplified complicated AI topics into
      simple, interesting lectures that even a non-technical person like me could understand them. The
      interactive discussions kept me motivated, and the prompt learning was quite beneficial in my college
      assignments lately. I feel more secure in my understanding of AI today, and I would absolutely suggest
      it to anyone interested in the topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a fantastic starting place!"

      I knew a little about AI before, but not much. This program really helped me understand it in a simple
      way . As a commerce student, I thought it would be hard, but everything was explained so well. I learned
      new things, and the mentor support &amp; interactive sessions were amazing . Now I feel more confident,
      and I'm really happy I joined! 😊

      I was nervous about AI, but this course changed everything. Step by step, I learned not just what AI can
      do, but how to use it in my daily life. The examples were so relatable and helpful. What I loved most
      was how simple everything was explained. It's amazing how much I learned in such a short time.

      To be honest, I was a bit skeptical about joining the course and learning about AI. But from the very
      first lesson, I felt like I was in good hands. The mentor was super knowledgeable and patient and
      explained everything in a way that just made sense. I am confident in my ability to work with AI and
      excited to see where this new skill takes me. From being somewhat clueless to confident in just weeks. I
      am glad I took the leap and invested in myself. If you are thinking about it and curious about AI and
      its possiblities I would say definitely give it a shot, just do it and it's perfect for beginners
      and experts alike.

        >AI is transforming the world, and regardless of our background, understanding its fundamentals has
        become important. As someone always fascinated by technology but never formally studied computer
        science, I actively seek opportunities to explore this field. That's how I came across 'Intro to AI'
        by "Women AI Collective" a beginner-friendly program designed to make AI accessible to young women.
        One of the highlights of this journey was working on my project "A Day with AI". I created a small
        comic showing how AI is part of our daily lives—from morning alarms to virtual assistants and work
        tasks. This helped me see how AI makes life easier in so many ways.<br /><br />A big thanks to our
        mentor
